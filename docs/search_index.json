The essence of stratified estimation is to aggregate observations of the response variable into groups or strata that are more homogeneous than the population as a whole. The population mean and its variance are estimated as weighted means ofwithin-strata means and variances where the weights are based on strata sizes. If the stratification is accomplished prior to sampling and the within-stratum variances are known or can be easily estimated, then greater precision may be achieved by selecting within-strata sampling intensities to be proportional to within-strata variances (Cochran, 1977). Following literature review I present a number of implementations that have been used to guide the stratification of ALS-derived structural variables for locating representative sample plots. Studies including (Leiterer et al. 2015) and (Kane et al. 2010) suggest that the information in the ALS data may be condensed to a few metrics. Many of the studies reviewed seem to adopt this by selecting a low number of metrics which they use to stratify the landscape and consequently sample within.(Fedrigo et al. 2018) further outlined: Lidar metrics may be useful for forest stand classification if they differentiate classes of interest (Wulder et al., 2008). The separation of the data into vertical layers allows metrics to be derived for specific forest strata, which may increase the discrimination of multi-strata stand types. The selection of breaks that define these strata can be based on field knowledge or identified statistically from lidar profiles (Lefsky et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2011). An additional note of interest is that a great deal of research in the field of digital soil mapping can be applied to structurally guided sampling. Studies including (Carré, McBratney, and Minasny 2007), (Ma et al. 2020), and (Malone, Minansy, and Brungard 2019) were invlauable for understanding how to use auxillary variables to determine effective sampling protocols - especially in the context of Lahin Hypercube Sampling. Stratification approaches (Hawbaker et al. 2009) Used ALS mean and SD to stratify. First they separated forest types then 10 strata were derived suing mean height. Within each stratum, 3 additional sub-strata were created using SD. This produced a total of 30 stratifications where one coniferous forest and two deciduous forest locations randomly selected. They compared samples taken from strata with a random sample finding that: &gt;Prediction errors from models constructed using a random sample were up to 68% larger than those from the models built with a stratified sample. The stratified sample included a greater range of variability than the random sample. (Dalponte et al. 2011) They analyzed 2 aspects of ground reference data collection. The positioning error of the ground plots The optimal number of training plots. They had a large collection of samples &gt;700 and systematically analyzed how the reduction of sample numbers influenced accuracy of attribute estimates. They tested the effect of error in estimate related to distance the center point of the plot was moved. The decrease was at a minimum when the displacement was less than 5 m, while it was considerable over 10 m. They did random downsampling of the sample plot number and stratified downsampling of the sample plot number. They used the methods from (Hawbaker et al. 2009) and (Maltamo et al. 2011) for stratified downsampling. Comparing the results obtained with the proposed stratified sampling method and the other three methods considered (see Table 3), one can see that the proposed stratified sampling method was the one that provided the best results for both sets. The new protocol allowed us to obtain promising results for the considered dataset: using only 53 training plots, instead of 534 in the original dataset, we obtained the same results for the validation set. (Maltamo et al. 2011) Used divided P90 into 12 even parts. A near equal number of sample plots were systematically chosen within each of these 12 parts according to the range of VEG (ratio of vegetation points and ground points). To representatively sample the 12 parts and to cover the extremes, selection intensity was higher in the p90 range range with the lowest number of previously established plots. The use of ALS data as a priori information provided the most accurate results. They also provide the an important statement: One should keep in mind that in real world applications ,some given ALS variables will have to be used for selection of plots regardless of which and how many biophysical properties the inventory aims at estimating. Thus, some ALS variables will work better for certain biophysical properties than for others. An appropriate way of choosing suitable ALS variables could be to select them according to the relative importance of the biophysical properties to be estimated.for volume and number of stems. plots. REduced total sample size incrementally. (Junttila et al. 2013) Used a number of approaches including a space filling design, which attempts to sample uniformly across a feature space. The Maximin design attempts to cover a feature space as uniformly as possible given a fixed number of sample points. It maximizes the minimum distance between plots. The results indicate that choosing the plots in a way that ensures ample coverage of both spatial and feature space variability improves the performance of the corresponding models, and that adequate coverage of the variability in the feature space is the most important condition that should be met by the set of plots collected. (Valbuena et al. 2013) Used the Cover metric to privde a idea of the density of each forest area. The justified that cover influenced the relation between other metrics and the forest response and, therefore, it was included in all the models computed. (Grafström and Ringvall 2013) Presents the (Grafström and Lisic 2019) package. and does comparisons between Simple random sampling (SRS) and: Local pivotal method with x and y coordinates (LPM-xy) to make sure the sample is well spread geographically. The Euclidean distance is used without standardization because the spatial coordinates are on the same scale. Local pivotal method (LPM) XY and four selected ALS variables as auxiliary variables. The samples are well spread geographically and well spread in the four ALS variables. The distance function (eq. (3)) is used. Cube method (CM) The samples are balanced on the four ALS variables. The x and y coordinates are not used for this method, because it does not make sense to balance on geographical coordinates. Local cube method (LCM) The samples are balanced on the four ALS variables and the x and y coordinates are used to make sure the sample is well spread geographically. The Euclidean distance is used in the geographical space. They found that spreading the sample well in geographical space is important. Spreading the sample well in all auxiliary variables (LPM) and using the HT estimator was in all cases a more efficient strategy than SRS followed by a calibration estimator. Spreading the sample well is more efficient than balancing (or SRS followed by calibration) if the relationship between the target and the auxiliary variables is nonlinear, which is why it performs better (see Tables 2 and 3). The final order of the designs combined with the calibration estimator was (from best to worst) LCM, LPM, LPM-xy, CM, and SRS. We get the best results when using the information both in the design and the estimator. Hence, we can conclude that using auxiliary information in the design is very important. \" All three designs, LCM, LPM, and CM, had very good design effects. The reduction of the variance of the HT estimator was for the main target variable volume up to 75% compared with SRS. (Grafström, Saarela, and Ene 2014) Continuation of previous study highlighting value of sampling methods. A possible drawback of the LPM compared with more simple methods such as systematic random sampling is that sample se- lection is computationally intensive for large populations. This is a problem because the population size (number of pixels) tends to be rather large in forest applications with auxiliary data from, e.g., airborne LiDAR, making it practically impossible to apply the LPM as it is. To deal with this problem, we introduce a new rapid suboptimal implementation ofthe LPM that can be applied to large populations. With the LPM, there is no stratification or other difficult design choices; we only need to define distance. Modelling is not really necessary, which means no complicated formulas. Yet this is a very competitive strategy in many cases. It has the advantage of being intuitive and simple, which should not be underrated. It also allows us to keep the traditional design-based approach, while still taking advantage of powerful auxiliary information.

(Niemi and Vauhkonen 2016) Used ALS textural CHM metrics (HIST,PATCH,GLCM,LBP) for pre-stratification of the inventory area. They tested the strength of the relationship between metrics and central attributes of forest growing stock (Vol,BA,Diam). It was found that the dispersion of the clusters derived in an unsupervised mode could be used as an indicator for prioritizing the plots to be measured as the sample to form the reference data for the wall-to-wall models. (Valbuena et al. 2017) Used a rule based method to stratify forest areas using Lmoments including Lcv and Lskew. (McRoberts, Chen, and Walters 2017) Modeling inventory attributes with ALS metrics. BA was considered as an integrator of all the response variables and was used as the basis for constructing strata using a lonear model. Predictions of BA were then scaled by the largest BA prediction,multiplied by 100, then assigned 1 of 100 potential strata. Strata were then aggregated these into 4,6,8 strata with approximately equal proportion of study area. Stratifications that are most effective with respect to minimizing variances are based on variables that are closely related to the response variable or variables of interest. When multiple response variables are to be estimated simultaneously, the same stratification must be used for all response variables to ensure compatibility. Results showed they were able to: &gt;Reduce sampling intensity by up to 35% without losing accuracy in the estimators. Relative to the simple random sampling estimators that used no stratification, use of four strata decreased SEs by 29.0%38.1%, depending on the response variable; relative to four strata, use of six strata reduced SEs by 2.3%7.3%; and relative to six strata, use of eight strata reduced SEs by no more than 4% and for two response variables actually increased SEs. From an operational perspective, the results of the study suggest that multivariate, airborne laser scanning-assisted inventories could be fairly easily implemented, subject to availability of the airborne laser scanning data. (Malone, Minansy, and Brungard 2019) They provide an indepth description of how to implement and improve the outputs of Latin Hypercube sampling, providing a coded example of how to incorporate already acquired samples accross the landscape. They specify a method to boostrap sample size followed by the application of multiple methods to determine the optimal sample number to use based on auxillary data. (Papa et al. 2020) Compared simple random sampling to stratified sampling within strata groups. Used hierarchical cluster analysis for formation of strata. Clusters were used for sub-sampling. The number of clusters was established by the Elbow method. Clusters were validated with an ANOVA post-hoc Tukey test. Varying size of metric cells (1, 0.5, 0.25 ha) were tested. The stratified sampling was simulated by using weighting distributed by strata, so that each segment was the same sample size, whereas no weighting was used for the simulation in the case of the simple random sampling. For each level of sampling size (number of plots in the inventory), 1000 iterations were performed, and their mean and standard deviation were summarized in order to produce a graph of relative uncertainty (standard error/global mean) as a function of sample intensity (proportion of total area sampled, in %). (Ma et al. 2020) They compare latin hypercube sampling and feature space coverage sampling for predicting soil classes. They detail specific functions to use for latin hypercube sampling and feature space coverage sampling. Sampling pools of varying sizes are compared to simple random sampling in a number of modeling approaches. Final results indicated that: 1)In both study areas the median overall accuracy with FSCS washigher than those with CLHS and SRS over all sample sizes and crossall three prediction methods. The median overall accuracy with CLHS was only marginally larger than with SRS. 2)There was a significant negative correlation betweenMSSSDandoverall accuracy, whereas no such correlation was found betweenO1 + O3and overall accuracy.The coefficient of variation in overall accuracy among samples se-lected using FSCS was smaller than these using CLHS and SRS at thesame sample sizes. 3)With CLHS the variation in overall accuracy among samples waslarge, so that there is a serious risk that a particular sample mightlead to a low overall accuracy. 4)FSCS-RF is the most accurate combination of sampling and predic-tion for both study areas Results indicated that feature space coverage sampling could be a viable method for locating samples. pre { max-height: 500px; overflow-y: auto; } pre[class] { max-height: 500px; } References "],["fund.html", "sgsR fundamentals Algorithm structure Example data Stratified rasters - sraster", " sgsR fundamentals Algorithm structure sgsR has been scripted primarily using the terra package for raster processing and the sf package for vector manipulation. There are 3 primary function verbs that the package currently uses: strat_* - The stratify verb implies that functions are applying stratification algorithms to an input metrics raster (mraster) and output a stratified raster (sraster) sample_* - The sample verb implies that functions are extracting samples from srasters produced from strat_* functions. A few algorithms (e.g. sample_srs, sample_balanced, sample_grid) are able to take mrasters as inputs as they are not dependent on stratified inputs for sampling. calculate_* - The calculate verb implies that functions are performing calculations to be used in consequent processing. The use of predefined sample analysis algorithms (calculate_ahels, calculate_coobs) are also included. Package Documentation I do not go into detail about the intricacies of each function in this document. Please see the documentation for functions e.g. ?sgsR::strat_kmeans for intended application and use of each function. Example data Worked examples of all functions are provided using data internal to the package. To load internal mraster and road access data we use the following code.

Stratified rasters - sraster For the purposes of this tutorial I am also going to show how to produce a basic sraster and existing sample data that we will used in examples below. To make the sraster we will use the strat_kmeans function where the input mraster will be stratified using a kmeans algorithm. #--- apply kmeans algorithm to metrics raster ---# sraster &lt;- strat_kmeans(mraster = mraster, # use mraster as input for sampling nStrata = 4, # algorithm will produce 4 strata plot = TRUE) # algorithm will plot output After the sraster is produced we apply the sample_srs algorithm which randomly samples points within our sraster to produce an existing sample dataset. #--- set seed ---# set.seed(2021) #--- apply kmeans algorithm to metrics raster ---# existing &lt;- sample_srs(raster = mraster, # use mraster as input for sampling nSamp = 200, # request 200 samples be taken mindist = 100, # define that samples must be 100 m apart plot = TRUE) # algorithm will plot output We now have mraster, access, sraster and existing data sets generated.

For further details about the algorithms used check out their package and also consult ?sgsR::strat_osb for references. The basics of this algorithm are to provide the number of desired strata nStrata and samples nSamp. The algorithm then analyzes the data for the optimal locations to establish breaks in the covariate metric, which are used as stratum boundaries. This function can take a bit longer to run so please be patient! For the purpses of this example I have used a limited number of nStrata and nSamp to ensure they run and render quickly. #--- perform optimum sample boundary stratification ---# strat_osb(mraster = mraster, # input metric = &quot;zsd&quot;, # covariate of interest - numeric index or character string nSamp = 50, # number of desired samples nStrata = 3, # number of desired strata plot = TRUE) # plot strat_osb(mraster = mraster, # input metric = 4, # covariate of interest - numeric index or character string nSamp = 25, # number of desired samples nStrata = 3, # number of desired strata plot = TRUE, # plot details = TRUE) # produce output details strat_osb(mraster = mraster, # input metric = &quot;zmax&quot;, # covariate of interest - numeric index or character string nSamp = 50, # number of desired samples nStrata = 3, # number of desired strata subset = 0.75, # used a subset of covariate data to determine optimum breaks filename = tempfile(fileext = &quot;.tif&quot;)) # write output sraster to file pre { max-height: 500px; overflow-y: auto; } pre[class] { max-height: 500px; } ## Reading layer `roads&#39; from data source `C:\\Users\\tgood.stu\\Documents\\R\\win-library\\4.1\\sgsR\\extdata\\roads.shp&#39; using driver `ESRI Shapefile&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 167 features and 36 fields ## Geometry type: MULTILINESTRING ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: 431100 ymin: 5337700 xmax: 438560 ymax: 5343240 ## Projected CRS: UTM_Zone_17_Northern_Hemisphere "],["sample.html", "sample_* functions Access sample_srs sample_grid sample_strat sample_clhs sample_balanced", " sample_* functions A total of 5 sample functions currently exist in the package: sample_srs - simple random sampling sample_grid- grid sampling sample_strat - stratified sampling within a sraster sample_clhs - Latin hypercube sampling algorithm sample_balanced - Balanced sampling (Grafström and Lisic 2019) Access A feature of the sample_* functions that may be of interest is the ability to define access. Users can supply a road access network (must be sf line objects) and define buffers around access where samples should be excluded and included. Important additional parameters when access is provided are: buff_inner - An inner buffer that defines the distance from access where samples cannot be takes (i.e. if you do not want samples within 50 m of your access layer set buff_inner = 50). buff_outer - Maximum distance samples can be located from access (i.e. if you dont want samples more than 200 meters from a road set buff_inner = 200) sample_srs We provided a very simple example of using the sample_srs function when we were preparing our existing data. We provide some additional examples below. Input raster Notice that the input for sample_srs is raster.

The algorithm uses a moving window (wrow and wcol parameters) to filter the input sraster for locations where stratum pixels are spatially grouped rather than dispersed individually across the landscape. The sampling is performed in 2 stages: Rule 1 - Sample within spatially grouped stratum pixels. Rule 2 - If no more samples exist to satisfy desired sampling count, individual stratum pixels are sampled. The rule applied to a select a particular sample is defined in the rule attribute of output samples. We give a few examples below: #--- perform stratified sampling random sampling ---# sample_strat(sraster = sraster, # input sraster nSamp = 200, # desired sample number plot = TRUE) # plot ## Simple feature collection with 199 features and 3 fields ## Geometry type: POINT ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: 431130 ymin: 5337770 xmax: 438510 ymax: 5343210 ## CRS: +proj=utm +zone=17 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs ## First 10 features: ## strata type rule geometry ## x 1 new rule1 POINT (432550 5340370) ## x1 1 new rule1 POINT (432550 5340370) ## x2 1 new rule1 POINT (436510 5341690) ## x3 1 new rule1 POINT (432110 5339970) ## x4 1 new rule1 POINT (434090 5338010) ## x5 1 new rule1 POINT (431470 5341690) ## x6 1 new rule1 POINT (431450 5341010) ## x7 1 new rule1 POINT (431490 5341530) ## x8 1 new rule1 POINT (432470 5341790) ## x9 1 new rule1 POINT (435510 5341150) In some cases, a user may wish to include an existing sample dataset within the algorithm. In order to adjust the total number of samples needed per stratum to reflect those already present in existing, we can use the utility function extract_strata. This function takes an input sraster and the existing sample dataset and extracts the stratum for each sample. These samples can then be input into the sample_strat function which adjusts total required sample per class based on representation in existing. #--- extract strata values to existing samples ---# e.sr &lt;- extract_strata(sraster = sraster, # input sraster existing = existing) # existing samples to add strata value to e.sr ## Simple feature collection with 200 features and 1 field ## Geometry type: POINT ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: 431110 ymin: 5337730 xmax: 438490 ymax: 5343230 ## Projected CRS: UTM Zone 17, Northern Hemisphere ## First 10 features: ## strata geometry ## 1 4 POINT (432070 5340130) ## 2 4 POINT (435010 5342150) ## 3 4 POINT (437390 5338370) ## 4 2 POINT (437850 5342890) ## 5 4 POINT (434710 5342370) ## 6 1 POINT (432870 5340230) ## 7 4 POINT (435150 5340150) ## 8 1 POINT (431850 5338570) ## 9 4 POINT (432770 5342710) ## 10 1 POINT (436190 5341450) Existing strata Notice that e.sr now has an attribute named strata.

A number of other functions in the sgsR package help to provide guidance on clhs sampling including calculate_lhsPop and calculate_lhsOpt. Be sure to check out those functions for better understanding of how to optimize sample numbers. Syntax for this function is similar to others shown above, though parameters like iter, which define the number of iterations within the Metropolis-Hastings process are important to consider. In these examples we use a low iter value because it takes less time to run. Default values for iter within the clhs package are 10,000. sample_clhs(mraster = mraster, # input nSamp = 200, # desired sample number plot = TRUE, # plot iter = 100) # number of iterations ## | | |

Samples are allocated based on the area coverage of strata within sraster. This function is utilized in a number of functions including sample_strat. #--- perform grid sampling ---# calculate_reqSamples(sraster = sraster, nSamp = 200) ## strata total ## 1 1 18 ## 2 2 65 ## 3 3 81 ## 4 4 36 #--- calculate existing samples to include ---# e.sr &lt;- extract_strata(sraster = sraster, existing = existing) calculate_reqSamples(sraster = sraster, nSamp = 200, existing = e.sr) ## strata total need ## 1 1 -2 18 ## 2 2 -3 65 ## 3 3 5 81 ## 4 4 0 36 Notice that some of the results above are negative. This indicates that the existing samples over represent those strata and that some sample should likely be removed to avoid over represenation. Sample evaluation algorithms The following algorithms were initially developed by Dr. Brendan Malone from the University of Sydney. In their work they graciously provided an in depth description of the functionality of these algorithms that were originally developed to improve soil sampling strategies. I have taken the initial scripts Dr. Malone provided to the community and implemented functions so they can be used for structurally guided sampling approaches. Many thanks to Dr. Malone for being an excellent collaborator and proponent of open source algorithms. Please consult the original reference for these ideas and scripts as they are extremely valuable and helpful for understanding their sampling rationale. Malone BP, Minansy B, Brungard C. 2019. Some methods to improve the utility of conditioned Latin hypercube sampling. PeerJ 7:e6451 DOI 10.7717/peerj.6451 calculate_ahels The calculate_ahels function performs the adapted Hypercube Evaluation of a Legacy Sample (ahels) algorithm using existing sample data and an mraster. New samples are allocated based on quantile ratios between the existing sample and mraster covariate dataset. This algorithm: Determines the quantile distributions of existing samples and mraster covariates. Determines quantiles where there is a disparity between samples and covariates. Prioritizes sampling within those quantile to improve representation. To use the function, the user will first specify the number of quantiles (nQuant) followed by either the nSamp (total number of desired samples to be added) or threshold (proportional represenation between sample and covariate quantiles - default is 0.9) parameters. Its recommended to use threshold values at or below 0.9 as higher values can currently cause the algorithm to add samples repeatedly. sample_ahels(mraster = mraster[[1:3]], # input mraster - first 3

This algorithm aids the user in determining where additional samples could be located by comparing existing samples to each pixel and associated mraster covariates. The output coobs raster could be used to constrain clhs sampling using the sample_clhs to areas that are underreprented. The coobs raster determines how many observations are similar in terms of the covariate space at every pixel. Given that this is fairly computationally intensive, I have implemented parallel processing for this function, but users should be patient to allow processing to complete. calculate_coobs(mraster = mraster, # input existing = existing, # existing samples cores = 4, # parallel cores to use details = TRUE, # provide details from algorithm output plot = TRUE, # plot filename = tempfile(fileext = &quot;.tif&quot;)) # write output raster to tif Latin hypercube sampling evaluation algorithms The following 2 algorithms provide a means to maximize the effectiveness of latin hypercube sampling protocols. calculate_lhsPop The calculate_lhsPop function calculates population level statistics about the mraster covariates being used including calculating principal components, quantile distributions, and KullbackLeibler divergence testing. The outputs from this function are mandatory for use of the calculate_lhsOpt function described in the next section. #--- by default all statistical data are calculated ---# calculate_lhsPop(mraster = mraster) # input The output details the following: $values - Pixel values from mraster $pcaLoad - PCA loadings $matQ - Quantile matrix $matCov - Covariate matrix #--- statistical analyses can be chose by setting their parameter to `FALSE` ---# calculate_lhsPop(mraster = mraster, # input nQuant = 10, # desired number of quantiles PCA = FALSE) # choose not to calculate PCA&#39;s calculate_lhsOpt The calculate_lhsOpt function performs an bootsrapped latin hypercube sampling approach where a population level analysis of mraster data is performed to determine the optimal Latin hypercube sample size. Using statistical data calculated using the calculate_lhsPop and varying sample sizes defined by minSamp, maxSamp, step and rep. Sampling protocols are conducted and statistical effectiveness of those sampling outcomes are evaluated to determine where sample size is minimized and statistical representation is maximized. This function is currently fairly slow to run as parallel is still being implemented. #--- calculate lhsPop details ---# poplhs &lt;- calculate_lhsPop(mraster = mr) calculate_lhsOpt(popLHS = poplhs) calculate_lhsOpt(popLHS = poplhs, PCA = FALSE, iter = 200) "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
