We examined whether LiDAR data could be used to directly assess the successional stage of forests by determining the degree to which the LiDAR data would show the same relative ranking of structural development among sites as would traditional field measurements. We sampled 94 primary and secondary sites (19-93, 223-350, and 600 years old) from three conifer forest zones in western Washington state, USA, in the field and with small-footprint, discrete return LiDAR. Seven sets of LiDAR metrics were tested to measure canopy structure. Ordinations using the of LiDAR 95th percentile height, rumple, and canopy density metrics had the strongest correlations with ordinations using two sets of field metrics (Procrustes R = 0.72 and 0.78) and a combined set of LiDAR and field metrics (Procrustes R = 0.95). These results suggest that LiDAR can accurately characterize forest successional stage where field measurements are not available. This has important implications for enabling basic and applied studies of forest structure at stand to landscape scales.},

abstract = {This article introduces a novel methodology for automated classification of forest areas from airborne laser scanning (ALS) datasets based on two direct and simple rules: L-coefficient of variation Lcv = 0.5 and L-skewness Lskew = 0, thresholds based on descriptors of the mathematical properties of ALS height distributions. We observed that, while Lcv {\textgreater} 0.5 may represent forests with large tree size inequality, Lskew {\textgreater} 0 can be an indicator for areas lacking a closed dominant canopy. Lcv = 0.5 discriminated forests with trees of approximately equal sizes (even tree size classes) from those with large tree size inequality (uneven tree size classes) with kappa $\kappa$ = 0.48 and overall accuracy OA = 92.4{\%}, while Lskew = 0 segregated oligophotic and euphotic zones with $\kappa$ = 0.56 and OA = 84.6{\%}. We showed that a supervised classification could only marginally improve some of these accuracy results. The rule-based approach presents a simple method for detecting structural properties key to tree competition and potential for natural regeneration. The study was carried out with low-density datasets from the national program on ALS surveying of Finland, which shows potential for replication with the ALS datasets typically acquired at nation-wide scales. Since the presented method was based on deductive mathematical rules for describing distributions, it stands out from inductive supervised and unsupervised classification methods which are more commonly used in remote sensing. Therefore, it presents an opportunity for deducing physical relations which could partly eliminate the need for supporting ALS applications with field plot data for training and modelling, at least in Boreal forest ecosystems.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper was to examine different plot selection strategies of field training plots in forest inventory using airborne laser scanner (ALS) data. The applied plot selection strategies were random selection, random selection within pre-stratification according to forest type, selection of plots according to geographical location and selection of plots based on properties of the ALS data given as a priori information. The study was conducted by means of simulation utilizing existing and independent training and validation plot data and the performance was evaluated by assessing bias and the root mean square error (RMSE). The accuracy of simultaneously derived biophysical stand properties, i.e. volume, number of stems and Lorey's mean height, was examined using non-parametric modelling. The use of ALS data as a priori information provided the most accurate results in the case of stand volume and number of stems the RMSE being less than 15 and 30 per cent, respectively. For the mean height, also the other selection strategies were as good but the most accurate alternative varied according to number of training plots used. In most cases, the RMSE values for the mean height were between 8 and 9 per cent. The bias of the different strategies followed the same patterns as the corresponding RMSE values. {\textcopyright} Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2010. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This study assessed a lidar-based, object-oriented (segmentation) approach to forest volume and aboveground biomass modeling. The study area in the Piedmont physiographic region of Virginia is composed of temperate coniferous, deciduous, and mixed stands. Segmentation objects, hierarchical in terms of area and ranging from 0.035 to 5.632 ha/object, were created using a lidar-derived canopy height model. Horizontal point (basal area) samples were used to calculate volume and aboveground biomass. Per-object lidar point (per return height and intensity) distributional parameters were extracted from small-footprint lidar. Adjusted R2 and Mallow's Cp metrics were used to select models for the range of segmentation results. Selected variables included intensity-based and structurally related first through fifth return height parameters. Object-based modeling (adjusted R2 = 0.58–0.79; various object sizes) resulted in distinct improvements over stand-based attempts (adjusted R2 = 0.40–0.73; majority adjusted R2 {\textless} 0.50). Adjusted R2 and RMSE values for deciduous volume (0.59; 51.15 m3/ha) and biomass (0.58; 37.41 Mg/ha) were better than those found for another, plot-based study in the study area. Coniferous R2 values for volume (0.66) and biomass (0.59) were lower than previous studies, which was attributed to variability within the relatively narrow volume range (6.94–50.93 m3/ha).},

abstract = {Background: Precision in describing plantation attributes is a key requirement for forestry managers and inventory surveys aim to extract the most precise information possible using the smallest number of plots. This paper quantifies the potential efficiencies to be gained by using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data as an aid to estimation of standing timber volume in softwood plantations. A range of inventory design and estimation methods were investigated in terms of their overall predictive efficiency. Methods: Field measurements representing four different populations from two Pinus radiata D. Don plantations in New South Wales, Australia, were used to inform statistical models which were then employed to simulate populations of inventory plots. These plots were then “surveyed” using a variety of simulated sampling strategies to quantify the benefits from using LiDAR data as auxiliary information. Model-based and design-based methods were both investigated. Survey design options included stratification and plot selection strategies; estimation options included ratio estimation and regression modelling. Results were compared in terms of the relative bias and root mean squared error of the estimates. Results: The study suggests that relative efficiencies of two-fold or better, are possible with either model-based or model-assisted estimators compared to traditional inventory surveys which use grid samples and simple design-based estimators. This would enable a halving in the required sample size for the same precision for field inventories in these plantations. Conclusion: The use of LiDAR data as an aid to survey design produces marked efficiency gains compared to traditional inventory methods.},

abstract = {In this study, Lorenz curve descriptors of tree diameter inequality were used to characterize the dynamics of forest development in a shelterwood-managed Pinus sylvestris (L.) dominated area. The purpose was to stratify the forest area into forest structural types (FST) from airborne laser scanning (ALS)-based wall-to-wall predictions of the chosen indicators: Gini coefficient (GC) and Lorenz asymmetry (LA). A clear boundary at GC = 0.5 was found, which separated even-sized (below) and uneven-sized (above) areas. Furthermore, a need for including LA in the characterization of the uneven-sized areas was detected, to distinguish bimodal from reverse J-shaped stands. Beta regression was used for the ALS predictions, yielding RMSEs of 19.67{\%} for GC and 11.01{\%} for LA. Based on our results, we concluded that forest disturbance decreases GC, whereas seed regeneration increases GC and, therefore, gap dynamics are characterized by shifts between either side of the GC = 0.5 threshold. In even-sized stands, GC decreases toward maturity owing to self-thinning occurring at the stem exclusion stage. In uneven-sized stands, the skewness of the Lorenz curve indicates understory development, as ingrowth decreases LA. The possible applications of the resulting FST map are discussed; for instance, in identifying areas needing silvicultural treatments or evaluating forest recovery from disturbances.},

abstract = {Legacy soil data form an important resource for digital soil mapping and are essential for calibration of models for predicting soil properties from environmental variables. Such data arise from traditional soil survey. Methods of soil survey are generally empirical and based on the mental development of the surveyor, correlating soil with underlying geology, landforms, vegetation and air-photo interpretation. There are no statistical criteria for traditional soil sampling, and this may lead to biases in the areas being sampled. The challenge is to test the use of legacy data for large-area mapping (e.g. national or continental extents) in order to limit the funds of field survey for large-area mapping. The problem is then to assess the reliability and quality of the legacy soil databases that have been mainly populated by traditional soil survey, and if there is a possibility of additional funding for sampling, to determine where new sampling units should be located. This additional sampling can be used to improve and validate the prediction model. Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) has been proposed as a sampling design for digital soil mapping when there is no prior sample. We use the principle of hypercube sampling to assess the quality of existing soil data and guide us to locations that need to be sampled. First an area is defined and the empirical environmental data layers or covariates are identified on a regular grid. The existing soil data are matched with the environmental variables. The HELS algorithm is used to check the occupancy of the legacy sampling units in the hypercube of the quantiles of the covarying environmental data. This is to determine whether legacy soil survey data occupy the hypercube uniformly or if there is over- or under-observation in the partitions of the hypercube. It also allows posterior estimation of the apparent probability of sample units being surveyed. From this information we can design further sampling. The methods are illustrated using legacy soil samples from Edgeroi, New South Wales, Australia, and from a large part of the Danube Basin. One third of the total number of sampling units are added to the original dataset. These new sampling units improve the representation of the feature space of the covariate. The standard deviation of the overall density is consequently smaller. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

abstract = {In high biodiversity areas, such as the Amazon, forest inventory is a challenge due to large variations in vegetation structure and inaccessibility. Capturing the full gradient of variability requires the acquisition of a large number of sample plots. Pre-stratified inventory is an efficient strategy that reduces sampling effort and cost. Low-cost remote sensing techniques may significantly expand pre-stratification capacity; however, the simplest option, satellite optical imagery, cannot detect small variations in primary forests. Alternatively, three-dimensional information obtained from airborne laser scanning (ALS, a.k.a. airborne lidar) has been successfully used to estimate structural parameters in tropical forests. Our objective was to assess to what extent forest plot sampling effort could be reduced, while accurately estimating mean vegetation characteristics in the landscape, by stratifying with ALS structural properties, relative to a random, uniformed conventional approach. The study was developed in an 800-ha area of wet Amazonian forest (Acre, Brazil), including portions of palms, bamboo and dense forest. We estimated relevant structural attributes from ALS: canopy height, openness, rugosity and fractions of leaf area index (LAI) along the vertical profile. We clustered vegetation to define heterogeneity into structural types, employing the Ward method and Euclidean distance. Also, principal component analysis was employed to characterize the groups using field and ALS-derived structural attributes. We simulated sampling intensities to estimate the gain in reducing the field efforts based on pre-stratified and non-stratified forest inventory scenarios. The resulting stratification clearly distinguished the forest's structural variation gradient and the vegetation density profile. For a fixed uncertainty of 10{\%} in basal area estimation, the ALS-aided stratified inventory reduced the necessary number of field plots by 41{\%}, relative to simple random sampling. The resulting reduction in sampling effort can offset the cost of ALS data collection, significantly enhancing its financial feasibility. In addition, ALS provides broad-coverage quantifications of basal area (or aboveground carbon stock), canopy structure, and accurate terrain characterization, which have an added value for forest management.},

abstract = {Ground reference data collection represents an important element in the prediction of stem volume with LiDAR-derived variables, and at present it is the most expensive part of such analyses. In this paper two aspects of ground reference data collection were analyzed: (1) the positioning error of the ground plots; and (2) the optimal number of training plots. A system for the prediction of stem volume at area-based level was adopted. LiDAR data were preprocessed and 13 variables describing both height and coverage were extracted. Models were defined using a stepwise ordinary least square (OLS) regression. Three experiments were conducted: (i) the role of the plots positioning error on prediction accuracy; (ii) the influence of random downsampling of plot numbers on prediction accuracy; and (iii) the influence of a stratified downsampling of plot numbers on prediction accuracy based on LiDAR-derived variables. A dataset comprising 799 ground plots was used. They were distributed throughout a mountainous area in the Southern Alps, where the presence of a complex landscape increases the uncertainty of the Global Positioning System (GPS) accuracy, and where a large variety of tree forest species and climatic environments make it necessary to have a large number of sample plots for accurate characterization of the study area. All the experiments provided important indications for LiDAR based forest inventories: the GPS error did not significantly influence the prediction accuracy and it was possible to reduce the number of training samples without compromising the generalization ability of the prediction model. Leading on from these findings, a new ground sampling protocol based on genetic algorithms was proposed. The new protocol allowed us to obtain promising results for the considered dataset: using only 53 training plots, instead of 534 in the original dataset, we obtained the same results for the validation set. These results, obtained in a complex mountainous area, are representative of Alpine environments and allow us to infer that similar (or better) results could also be obtained within non mountainous areas. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

When full cover auxiliary information is available at the planning stage of a forest inventory, an efficient strategy for sampling is formed by making sure that the sample is well spread in the space spanned by the auxiliary variables. We show that by using such a sampling design, we can improve not only design-based estimation, but also estimation based on nearest neighbour techniques. A new technique to select well-spread probability samples, in multidimensional spaces, from larger populations is introduced. As an application, we illustrate how this strategy can be applied to a forest field inventory. We use an artificial dataset corresponding to a full cover forest remote sensing inventory of a 30 000 ha area of Kuortane, western Finland. The target variable (growing stock volume) has been generated for the entire area by a copula technique.

abstract = {It is becoming more common that auxiliary information from remote sensing is available at the planning stage of a forest field inventory. Recent developments in sampling theory allows the inclusion of such information in the sampling design to obtain better samples and, hence, improve estimates of common forest attributes. We explain the methodology and evaluate the possibility of including data from airborne laser scanning in the sampling design. The novel designs that we use can select samples that are balanced on a set of auxiliary variables and (or) well spread in a set of auxiliary variables. The results from a simulation study with real data indicate that significant improvement is achieved.},

abstract = {Field measurements conducted on sample plots are a major cost component in airborne laser scanning (ALS) based forest inventories, as field data is needed to obtain reference variables for the statistical models. The ALS data also provides an excellent source of prior information that may be used in the design phase of the field survey to reduce the size of the field data set. In the current study, we acquired two independent modeling data sets: one with ALS-assisted and another with random plot selection. A third data set was used for validation. One canopy height and one canopy density variable were used as a basis for the ALS-assisted selection. Ordinary and partial least squares regressions for stem volume were fitted for four different strata using the two data sets separately. The results show that the ALS-assisted plot selection helped to decrease the root mean square error (RMSE) of the predicted volume. Although the differences in RMSE were relatively small, models based on random plot selection showed larger mean differences from the reference in the independent validation data. Furthermore, a sub-sampling experiment showed that 40 well placed plots should be enough for fairly reliable predictions.},

abstract = {National forest inventories have a long history of using remotely sensed auxiliary information to enhance estimation of forest parameters. For this purpose, aerial photography and satellite spectral data have been shown to be effective as sources of information in support of stratified estimators. These spectral-based stratifications are much more effective for reducing variances for forest area-related parameters than for parameters related to continuous attributes such as volume and biomass. For variables related to the latter attributes, stratified estimators using airborne laser scanning auxiliary data are much more effective, but are less effective than model-assisted estimators using the same auxiliary data. For inventory applications, however, stratified estimators using the same stratification for all response variables are naturally multivariate, whereas model-assisted estimators are not. A consequence is that multiple, univariate applications of model-assisted estimators cannot ensure compatibility among estimates of inventory parameters related to variables such as forest area, growing stock volume, and tree density. The objectives of the study were twofold: (1) to optimize a multivariate, k-NN approach for simultaneously predicting multiple forest inventory variables; and (2) to compare multivariate model-assisted generalized regression estimators using optimized k-NN predictions to post-stratified estimators with respect to inferences in the form of confidence intervals for multiple forest inventory parameters. The analyses included use of airborne laser scanning data as auxiliary information and the multivariate k-NN technique for prediction in support of the model-assisted estimators. The study area was in north central Minnesota in the USA and is characterized by both lowland and upland forest types interspersed with wetlands and lakes. The first primary result was that the optimized k-NN technique in combination with a model-assisted estimator produced compatible multivariate estimates of population means for six inventory parameters. Second, variances for the multivariate model-assisted estimators were smaller by 23{\%}–35{\%} than variances for a post-stratified estimator. These results warrant serious consideration of this approach for operational implementation by national forest inventories.},

Landsat imagery has been shown to be a source of auxiliary information that can be used with stratified estimation to increase the precision of estimates, although the increase is greater for estimates of forest area than for estimates of growing stock volume. The objective of the study was to assess the utility of lidar-based stratifications for increasing the precision of mean proportion forest area and mean growing stock volume per unit area. Stratifications based on nonlinear logistic regression model predictions of volume obtained from lidar data reduced variances of mean growing stock volume estimates by factors as great as 3.2 and variances of mean proportion forest area estimates by factors as great as 1.5. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {LiDAR data are increasingly available from both airborne and spaceborne missions to map elevation and vegetation, structure. Additionally, global coverage may soon become available with NASA's planned DESDynI sensor. However, substantial challenges remain to using the growing body of LiDAR data. First, the large volumes of data generated by LiDAR sensors require efficient processing methods. Second, efficient sampling methods are needed to collect the field data used to relate LiDAR data with vegetation structure. In this paper, we used low-density LiDAR data, summarized within pixels of a regular grid, to estimate forest structure and biomass across a 53,600 ha study area in northeastern Wisconsin. Additionally, we compared the predictive ability of models constructed from a random sample to a sample stratified using mean and standard deviation of LiDAR heights. Our models explained between 65 to 88{\%} of the variability in DBH, basal area, tree height, and biomass. Prediction errors from models constructed using a random, sample were up to 68{\%} larger than those from the models built with a stratified sample. The stratified sample included a greater range of variability than, the random sample. Thus, applying the random sample model to the entire population violated a tenet of regression analysis; namely, that models should not be used to extrapolate beyond the range of data from which they were constructed. Our results highlight that LiDAR data integrated with field data sampling designs can provide broad-scale assessments of vegetation structure and biomass, i.e., information crucial for carbon and biodiversity science.

abstract = {Recently airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) has emerged as a highly accurate remote sensing modality to be used in operational scale forest inventories. Inventories conducted with the help of LiDAR are most often model-based, i.e. they use variables derived from LiDAR point clouds as the predictive variables that are to be calibrated using field plots. The measurement of the necessary field plots is a time-consuming and statistically sensitive process. Because of this, current practice often presumes hundreds of plots to be collected. But since these plots are only used to calibrate regression models, it should be possible to minimize the number of plots needed by carefully selecting the plots to be measured. In the current study, we compare several systematic and random methods for calibration plot selection, with the specific aim that they be used in LiDAR based regression models for forest parameters, especially above-ground biomass. The primary criteria compared are based on both spatial representativity as well as on their coverage of the variability of the forest features measured. In the former case, it is important also to take into account spatial auto-correlation between the plots. The results indicate that choosing the plots in a way that ensures ample coverage of both spatial and feature space variability improves the performance of the corresponding models, and that adequate coverage of the variability in the feature space is the most important condition that should be met by the set of plots collected. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Niemi2016,
abstract = {Area-based analyses of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data are an established approach to obtain wall-to-wall predictions of forest characteristics for vast areas. The analyses of sparse data in particular are based on the height value distributions, which do not produce optimal information on the horizontal forest structure. We evaluated the complementary potential of features quantifying the textural variation of ALS-based canopy height models (CHMs) for both supervised (linear regression) and unsupervised ($\kappa$-Means clustering) analyses. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we identified a total of four texture analysis methods that produced rotation-invariant features of different order and scale. The CHMs and the textural features were derived from practical sparse-density, leaf-off ALS data originally acquired for ground elevation modeling. The features were extracted from a circular window of 254 m2 and related with boreal forest characteristics observed from altogether 155 field sample plots. Features based on gray-level histograms, distribution of forest patches, and gray-level co-occurrence matrices were related with plot volume, basal area, and mean diameter with coefficients of determination (R2) of up to 0.63-0.70, whereas features that measured the uniformity of local binary patterns of the CHMs performed poorer. Overall, the textural features compared favorably with benchmark features based on the point data, indicating that the textural features contain additional information useful for the prediction of forest characteristics. Due to the developed processing routines for raster data, the CHM features may potentially be extracted with a lower computational burden, which promotes their use for applications such as pre-stratification or guiding the field plot sampling based solely on ALS data.},

abstract = {Light detection and ranging (lidar) data have been increasingly used for forest classification due to its ability to penetrate the forest canopy and provide detail about the structure of the lower strata. In this study we demonstrate forest classification approaches using airborne lidar data as inputs to random forest and linear unmixing classification algorithms. Our results demonstrated that both random forest and linear unmixing models identified a distribution of rainforest and eucalypt stands that was comparable to existing ecological vegetation class (EVC) maps based primarily on manual interpretation of high resolution aerial imagery. Rainforest stands were also identified in the region that have not previously been identified in the EVC maps. The transition between stand types was better characterised by the random forest modelling approach. In contrast, the linear unmixing model placed greater emphasis on field plots selected as endmembers which may not have captured the variability in stand structure within a single stand type. The random forest model had the highest overall accuracy (84{\%}) and Cohen's kappa coefficient (0.62). However, the classification accuracy was only marginally better than linear unmixing. The random forest model was applied to a region in the Central Highlands of south-eastern Australia to produce maps of stand type probability, including areas of transition (the ‘ecotone') between rainforest and eucalypt forest. The resulting map provided a detailed delineation of forest classes, which specifically recognised the coalescing of stand types at the landscape scale. This represents a key step towards mapping the structural and spatial complexity of these ecosystems, which is important for both their management and conservation.},
